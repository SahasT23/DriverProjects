# Kernel Development Project Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This design document outlines the architecture and design considerations for the development of a custom operating system kernel. The kernel is the core component of an operating system, responsible for managing system resources and facilitating communication between hardware and software. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the kernel's design, including its core functionalities, architecture, and development approach.

### 1.2 Scope
The project aims to develop a kernel that includes process management, memory management, device management, file system management, and system call handling. The kernel will be designed to operate in a modern computing environment, supporting essential features for process and memory management while providing a framework for device and file system management.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Kernel**: The central component of an operating system that manages hardware and system resources.
- **Process**: An instance of a program in execution.
- **Memory Management**: The process of managing computer memory, including RAM and virtual memory.
- **Device Driver**: Software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.
- **System Call**: An interface through which user applications request services from the kernel.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Architecture
The kernel architecture will be designed using a modular approach, with the following core components:

- **Process Management**
- **Memory Management**
- **Device Management**
- **File System Management**
- **System Call Interface**

### 2.2 Design Goals
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient process scheduling and memory management.
- **Stability**: Provide robust error handling and system stability.
- **Scalability**: Support a wide range of hardware configurations and workloads.
- **Security**: Implement mechanisms to protect system resources and ensure process isolation.

## 3. Detailed Design

### 3.1 Process Management

#### 3.1.1 Process Lifecycle
Processes will transition through the following states:
- **New**: The process is being created.
- **Ready**: The process is ready to execute.
- **Running**: The process is currently executing.
- **Waiting**: The process is waiting for an I/O operation or event.
- **Terminated**: The process has completed execution or has been terminated.

#### 3.1.2 Context Switching
The kernel will implement context switching to handle multitasking. This involves saving the state of the currently running process and loading the state of the next process to be executed.

#### 3.1.3 Scheduling Algorithms
Scheduling will use a combination of the following algorithms:
- **Round-Robin**: Each process gets a fixed time slice in a circular order.
- **Priority-Based**: Processes are scheduled based on priority.
- **Multilevel Queue**: Processes are grouped into queues with different scheduling policies.

### 3.2 Memory Management

#### 3.2.1 Virtual Memory
The kernel will use virtual memory to provide the illusion of a large contiguous memory space. This will involve paging and segmentation.

#### 3.2.2 Paging
Paging will divide virtual memory into fixed-size pages and map them to physical memory frames. The kernel will maintain a page table for this mapping.

#### 3.2.3 Segmentation
Segmentation will be used to divide memory into logical segments (e.g., code, data, stack). Each segment will have its own base and limit for memory management.

### 3.3 Device Management

#### 3.3.1 Device Drivers
Device drivers will be implemented as kernel modules to interface with hardware devices. The kernel will dynamically load and manage these drivers as needed.

#### 3.3.2 Interrupt Handling
The kernel will handle interrupts by executing Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) to respond to hardware events promptly.

### 3.4 File System Management

#### 3.4.1 File System Interface
The kernel will provide a unified interface for file operations (e.g., create, delete, read, write) to applications.

#### 3.4.2 Inodes and Directory Structure
Files will be represented using inodes, which store metadata. The directory structure will organize files and directories in a hierarchical manner.

### 3.5 System Calls

#### 3.5.1 System Call Interface
The kernel will expose system calls for user applications to request services. System calls will involve switching from user mode to kernel mode, executing the requested operation, and returning to user mode.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Development Environment
- **Programming Languages**: C for kernel development, Assembly for low-level operations.
- **Development Tools**: GCC for compilation, GDB for debugging, QEMU for virtualization and testing.

### 4.2 Milestones
1. **Kernel Bootstrapping**: Develop the basic kernel that can boot and initialize hardware.
2. **Process Management**: Implement process scheduling and context switching.
3. **Memory Management**: Implement virtual memory, paging, and segmentation.
4. **Device Management**: Develop device drivers and interrupt handling.
5. **File System Management**: Implement the file system interface and directory structure.
6. **System Calls**: Develop the system call interface and handlers.
7. **Testing and Optimization**: Perform extensive testing and optimize performance.

### 4.3 Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components (e.g., memory management, process scheduling).
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components (e.g., process management with file system).
- **System Testing**: Test the entire kernel in a virtualized environment to ensure overall functionality and stability.
